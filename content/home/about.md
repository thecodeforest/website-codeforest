# Biography

I love asking big questions and answering them with data. My background is in Psychology and Statistics, and it’s been a blast seeing how these fields have co-evolved over the years. I currently work as a data scientist, and I started this blog as a way to document a few of the more interesting topics I’ve encountered throughout my journeys. The goal is to abstract away some of the technical bits in an attempt to give you (the reader) the ability to implement while learning. I’m always interested in connecting with fellow data-scientists/whisperers/magicians/analysts, so feel free to PM me on linkedin!
